# SoftwareDevelopmet1_Projects
To develop software which requires significant "problem solving" effort. The project should be sufficiently large and the size of the project will mostly depend on "problem solving" effort.

One of the objectives of this lab is to teach and test how students can handle large code, i.e. a project. Although the use of the library is not prohibited, the specific tasks that will be performed using the library may not be assessed. Therefore, the size of the project done using the library is expected to be larger than the size of the project done using the raw code, so that even using the library, the student has enough raw code or problem solving effort, which must be able to convince the evaluators.
